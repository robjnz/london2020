London Is Open to Visitors
</div>
<br />

Many of London attractions are now reopening to visitors.  
With limitations to their opening hours and the number of visitors allowed at any one time.  

<br />

 Most attractions  now require you to pre book online for a specific time slot, and take details of all visitors in case of an outbreak of covid19.

<br >

This is due to the current, government covid19 guideline, of social distancing of 2 metres, washing your hands, and wearing of a face mask in confined spaces.
